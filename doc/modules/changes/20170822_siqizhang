New: a new boundary temperature plugin that the core mantle boundary temperature evolves through time 
by calculating the heat flux through core mantle boundary and solving the core energy balance. 
A postprocessor of the core evolution is also added. It is used in our paper Zhang & O'Neill [2016] 
and it could be useful for people interested in long term planetary evolution.
